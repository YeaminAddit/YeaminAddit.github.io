This project is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" interactive story built using HTML and CSS. The story guides users through different pathways, where each page presents a unique scenario and two choices, allowing them to navigate their own story route. The HTML pages contain essential tags, including headers, paragraphs, images, and links, creating a cohesive adventure experience. The process involved planning the story flow, structuring each HTML file with navigational links, and styling with CSS for visual appeal. CSS styling added color, fonts, and hover effects to enhance readability and engagement, while careful image selection ensured compliance with Creative Commons licensing
